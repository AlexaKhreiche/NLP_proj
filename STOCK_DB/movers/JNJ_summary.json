  "summary": "Based on the provided article text, the stock of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) might be moving due to the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) recommendation for the approval of an indication extension of Janssen-Cilag International NV's drug, DARZALEX\u00ae (daratumumab) subcutaneous (SC) formulation, in the frontline setting for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). This recommendation is supported by the results from the CEPHEUS study, which demonstrated improved progression-free survival in the frontline setting for daratumumab-VRd compared to VRd for patients with NDMM who are transplant ineligible or for whom autologous stem-cell transplant (ASCT) was not planned as initial therapy.\n\nThe potential negative impact on JNJ's stock could be due to increased competition, pricing pressure, safety concerns, regulatory risk, and dependence on daratumumab. The approval of daratumumab for the frontline treatment of NDMM could increase competition in the multiple myeloma market, potentially leading to a decrease in market share and revenue for JNJ. Additionally, the approval could lead to pricing pressure, as payers and healthcare providers may demand lower prices due to increased competition. Safety concerns and regulatory risk could also negatively impact JNJ's stock if any safety issues arise during the approval process or post-approval or if there are any delays or denials in the approval process. Lastly, JNJ's success in the multiple myeloma market is heavily dependent on daratumumab, and any negative impact on daratumumab's performance could negatively impact JNJ's stock.",
