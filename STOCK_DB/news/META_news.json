We recently compiled a list of the12 AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks on Wall Street's radar. Almost 50 House Democrats have signed a message to stop the unauthorized use of AI tools in the government. Members of Congress have asked to cease applying any unauthorized artificial intelligence system that will aid in curbing government spending. President Donald Trump has set up DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency. Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk has been assigned the responsibility to cut what DOGE will say is waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal bureaucracy.

The Democrats have acknowledged that artificial intelligence holds the potential to modernize the US government. However, it also highlighted the potential concerns related to employee monitoring and access to sensitive data by DOGE and its AI tools. \"These present serious security risks, self-dealing, and potential criminal liability if not handled correctly, and have the potential to undermine successful and appropriate AI adoption,\" The Democrats have further demanded that the administration terminate the use of any AI systems that haven’t been formally approved through processes such as FedRAMP or that have been unable to meet existing legal requirements. The letter, addressed to the White House Office of Management and Budget, was also questioned on whether any of the technology used by the administration was powered by Musk’s company, xAI. This question, in particular, has been asked to clarify any potential conflicts of interest. According to the Democrats, these would be \"exponentially worse if Musk pursues further contracts to become a major provider of government AI services.\" The White House has recently introduced new policies on federal agency AI use and the federal government. “President Trump recognizes that AI is a technology that will define the future. This administration is focused on encouraging and promoting American AI innovation and global leadership, which starts with utilizing these emerging technologies within the Federal Government. Today’s revised memos offer much needed guidance on AI adoption and procurement that will remove unnecessary bureaucratic restrictions, allow agencies to be more efficient and cost-effective, and support a competitive American AI marketplace.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

On April 16, Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the firm’s price target on the stock to $624 from $790 and kept an “Overweight” rating on the shares. With the Q1 earnings season for the firm’s internet coverage sector kicking off next week, results are likely going to be “mixed” due to growing macro uncertainties, tariff impacts, and consumer pull-in ahead of tariffs. The firm believes that the best way to “generate alpha” in the earnings season is to adopt a defensive strategy with the potential to play idiosyncratic themes. The firm also believes that the overall economy will slow down, and this degree of macro slowdown is factored into Q2 and second-half estimates. Overall METAranks 3rdon our list of the AI stocks on Wall Street's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

    "full_article_text": "Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. As US stocks (^DJI,^GSPC,^IXIC) sell off, Solidarity Capital CEO Jeff McClean sits down withJosh Liptonto check in on the \"Magnificent Seven,\" made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. We were talking off camera, Jeff, maybe just broader picture. You see a day like today, I got red everywhere again. Your clients, I'm sure are calling you a lot with a lot of questions. What are they asking you, Jeff? What what what's the big question? What's the big worry? What are you hearing? Yeah, I think a lot of it is is a crash coming. I mean, I literally got text over the weekend with that exact question. And I What did what did you say back? What did what did you say back? No. Like we're already down significantly year to date. Like this has not been a quick uh sudden thing overnight. It's been happening over the past couple weeks of a deterioration. The speed is Yeah, the speed from February 19th to April 7th was dramatic. But I think now the extreme volatility, knock on wood is hopefully behind us and the volatility will stay elevated. The VIX, I think it's going to stay in the 20s for the long foreseeable future here. But I don't see us having extreme 5%, 7%, 9% days, things like that. I think that's going to come down, but the overarching issue is how long does this last? And that's where we get a little nervous. Right. So your clients say, \"Jeff, what's going to come next?\" And you tell them what? I tell them one of two things has to happen. Either consumer and CEO sentiment has to veer from very bearish, like it is right now, to something more neutral or the data is going to catch up to the sentiment and we're going to be led into a recession. Right? If consumers are scared and like they are right now, some of the survey data says it's like 2008, 2009 out there in their minds. Now, that's not on par with reality, but that'll show up in the checkbooks. That'll show up in the spending. And same with CEOs of their indicators towards recession, sky high, right? Of what they're nervous about. So one of those two things have to happen. Sentiment shifts or we are going to have that sentiment lead us into a recession. Right. The CEOs are what gets a lot of headline, a lot of people's attention, right? Because to the extent that a CEO starts to say, \"Listen, I I'm going to just sit on my hands for now. Any any plans I had to invest and spend and hire, I'm going to put that on ice.\" I mean, that is seems to me the big concern. Right. And if they pull back again, like right now it's not showing up in in earnings yet, right? And I don't think it'll show up in earnings for another couple weeks. But if it continues to go on, you're going to see the pull back in CAPEX, which going to have secondary third order effects, whether you're a software company, whether you're equipment provider, whatever it is, it's going to have effects if that doesn't turn. Now, some of this may turn naturally, right? Everyone's we're getting used to Trump again, right? Every tweet, every Truth Social post freaks people out. But I think over time, even though he's going to continue to do it, we'll be a bit more used to it. Yeah. Let me ask you, let's talk about some specific names and groups. I'm sure you must get questions, for example, about the MAG 7. Some of these names have gotten really banged up, right? Do you see opportunity in those names? Are you holding off? How do you think about them? Yeah. Yeah, I think it depends on which MAG 7 we're talking about. Like Apple is still down about 20% year to date. Um at one point it was down 30%. I think Apple, nothing fundamentally changed with their business. I think they're big enough, smart enough to get around the tariff issues where it hurts, obviously, small businesses. But from an Apple perspective, they'll be fine. Google, meta, both are in kind of their own self-created turmoil right now with the anti-trust issues. Yeah. So Uncle Sam has them in their sights. Yeah. I mean, they're at different levels. Like Google already has been found guilty. Now we're just deciding punishment phase, but I'm bullish on Google because we think the parts are worth more than the sum. So if they do get broken apart, YouTube's incredible trillion dollar business. Search, trillion dollar business. AdEx, really big hundred million dollar business. All these things are worth a ton of money. Meta is in a world of hurt, I think, because they don't have any friends right now. The Trump administration is going after them. The last administration was going after them. They don't like them. So anti-trust is inherently political. And so they have problems. And so they have problems. So Alphabet 2, I know you own and hold. Would you be adding here? Correct. Yeah, we're adding incrementally to Alphabet again. Right now, the tenuous nature of what the judgment is going to be is giving us pause from additional adding right now because that's going to hopefully come out here in the next week or two of what the decision there. That'll be appealed, but we need to know what the baseline is. And is the same for So meta, is that on the same the same thing? It's on your watch list, but you're not moving in yet? Yeah, we're a little hesitant on meta. If it wasn't for the trial right now, we'd be all in from a current valuation perspective. Meta is super appealing. Well, that's what I was going to ask you as we were talking about this. I was going to ask you, do you think some of that some of this bad news is priced in at this point? Well, that's what I going to ask you. We were talking about this. I was ask you, do you think some of that some of this bad news is priced in at this point? A little bit, but the uncertainty of exactly what the result is, because how I feel about Google is different how I feel about meta. I think meta needs to be together. If you broke that apart, Instagram here, uh Facebook over here, right? Um WhatsApp over there. I I don't think those work as well together separately as they do together. So I think it'll be interesting if they can sneak out with a fine as like a giant fine, right? As opposed to being broken up. I think that's their best case scenario right now is pay a couple billion dollar fine. Best case, couple billion. Jeff, great to see you always. I appreciate it. Thanks."

Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,and more.Learn More Key Points If the choppiness in the markets has you concerned, there's one thing you can focus on that will help calm any uneasiness: the long term. By shifting your focus from what will happen during the next few weeks to what will happen over the next few years, you can ignore the short-term noise driving the markets. At the end of the day, you need to ask yourself: \"Will this matter in three to five years?\" While the knee-jerk reaction may be, \"yes,\" think about what was going on five years ago: COVID-19. Many people were convinced that we would never return to in-person work, but that turned out to be a mostly false prediction. However, many of the strong tech companies continued their dominance amid difficult circumstances and grew stronger despite significant headwinds. I think the market is in a similar situation today, and investors should consider scooping up these three beaten-down tech stocks that will likely be stronger five years from now. My picks for stocks that will be just fine three to five years from now areAmazon(AMZN2.65%),Meta Platforms(META1.07%), andThe Trade Desk(TTD1.22%). All three are experiencing some short-term headwinds with tariffs and economic uncertainty, but that likely won't matter a few years from now. Amazon is one that many have keyed in on, and it could be wrecked by tariffs. It doesn't take much searching on Amazon's website to find that a considerable number of its products are made in China. Although theexact tariff figureon Chinese goods is rapidly changing, it's incredibly high. This could eat into Amazon's profits, which wouldn't bode well for the stock. However, investors need to focus on the facts. If we enter a prolonged trade war with China, suppliers will move supply chains elsewhere, which will likely be resolved within three to five years. Also, Amazon doesn't generate a ton of profits from the goods it sells. Retailers don't make a lot of money from their products; they make their profits on volume. TakeWalmart, for example. Over the past year, it sold $681 billion in goods but only made a $19.4 billion profit -- a 2.9% margin. In comparison, Amazon's profit margin was 9.3% over the past year. So, does this mean Amazon makes more from its commerce segment? Absolutely not. Instead, Amazon gets a boost from other inherently high-margin divisions within its company. Subscription services, ad services, and Amazon Web Services (AWS, its cloud computing division) all have much higher margins to drive Amazon's profits. For reference, AWS made up only 17% of Amazon's revenue in 2024, yet produced 58% of itsoperating profits. These divisions won't be affected much by an economic downturn and will continue pushing Amazon's stock higher over the next few years. Meta Platforms is better known by its former name, Facebook. Meta is the parent company of social media sites Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. These apps make money through advertisements, which is a huge cash cow for Meta. Ad budgets are usually cut during an economic downturn, which could harm Meta's business. We saw this briefly during COVID-19 and in late 2022 and 2023, when most of the market was convinced we were headed for a recession.  META Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)data byYCharts However, Meta's revenue always bounces back stronger than ever following these brief dips. I believe we'll see something similar throughout 2025, but its five-year revenue will likely be much higher, which will also drive the stock price up. So the sale price you're getting today on Meta's stock is a great bargain. Similar to Meta, The Trade Desk operates in the ad environment but it acts as an intermediary between ad buyers and sellers to ensure that buyers place their content in the best locations. While The Trade Desk could see a revenue dip similar to Meta, it has an even bigger problem: platform migration. During the fourth quarter, The Trade Desk migrated its users from its old Solimar platform to Kokai, which had some execution issues. This caused The Trade Desk to miss revenue guidance for the first time in company history, which caused the stock to sell off heavily. However, this issue won't be present five years down the road. What will be even more prevalent is programmatic advertising, which uses artificial intelligence to process how an ad campaign is performing and tweak as necessary to provide peak performance. The Trade Desk is a market leader in this area, and I'm confident that it will be just as dominant five years from now as it is today. While the road may be a bit bumpy between now and five years from now, I'm confident that The Trade Desk's stock will be much higher,prompting me to add more shares to my position.
